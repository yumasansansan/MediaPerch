# What the decoders actually produce

The companion to [devices.md](devices.md): that one records what real hardware
accepts, this one records what real decoders produce. Every row was measured with
`mediaperch-probe decode`, which prints the SHA-256 of the PCM a decoder handed
over, and cross-checked against FFmpeg decoding the same file.

The method matters more than the table. A decoder that quietly converts is
indistinguishable from one that does not, unless you hash the output and compare
it with something that had no reason to make the same mistake.

```
mediaperch-probe decode --file X.flac --decoder native
ffmpeg -i X.flac -f s16le out.raw     # then hash out.raw
```

## The two decoders

| | `decode_native` | `decode_mf` |
|---|---|---|
| Behind it | `dr_wav` and `dr_flac`, vendored | Media Foundation's source reader |
| Covers | WAV, FLAC | MP4/M4A, MP3, WMA — and WAV and FLAC |
| Probe score for WAV/FLAC | 100 | 40 |
| Ships as | 220 KB beside the executable | nothing; it is already on the machine |

`decode_mf` scores itself lower on WAV and FLAC not because it is worse at them —
the hashes below say it is not — but because it reaches them through a pipeline
that *could* insert a converter, and `decode_native` cannot.

## Bit-exactness

All four hashes per row are the same value: the file, both decoders, and FFmpeg.

| File | Reported format | `native` | `mf` | FFmpeg |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16-bit WAV, 44100 | `S16` | `6ad3ba58` | `6ad3ba58` | `6ad3ba58` |
| 16-bit FLAC, 44100 | `S16` | `6ad3ba58` | `6ad3ba58` | `6ad3ba58` |
| 24-bit WAV, 44100 | `S24_PACKED` | `7bb1010b` | `7bb1010b` | `7bb1010b` |
| 24-bit FLAC, 44100 | `S24_PACKED` | `7bb1010b` | `7bb1010b` | `7bb1010b` |
| **32-bit WAV, 768000** | `S32` | `29a25188` | `29a25188` | `29a25188` |
| **32-bit WAV, 1048575** | `S32` | `3eb96f05` | `3eb96f05` | `3eb96f05` |
| 24-bit FLAC, 768000 | `S24_PACKED` | `4b2e98d0` | refused | `4b2e98d0` |
| 24-bit FLAC, 1048575 | `S24_PACKED` | `14693cb7` | refused | `14693cb7` |
| **32-bit FLAC**, any rate | `S32` | **refused** | **refused** | `faf4b06d` etc. |

The 32-bit FLAC row is the interesting one, and it is covered below.

**Media Foundation is bit-exact for WAV and FLAC.** That was not safe to assume:
a source reader will insert a converter to produce whatever media type it is asked
for, and the conversion is invisible. `decode_mf` therefore asks for the *native*
depth, reads back what the reader agreed to, and reports that rather than what it
asked for — see §14 of [the plan](plan.md).

One difference, and it is metadata rather than samples: for FLAC, Media Foundation
reports a channel mask (`0x3` for stereo) where `dr_flac` reports none, because
FLAC has no channel-mask field and the two disagree about supplying the
conventional one. It changes which candidate is offered to a device first and
nothing else.

## 32-bit FLAC: nothing here can play it, and it used to say nothing

FLAC has allowed 32-bit samples since version 1.4. The reference encoder produces
them; `flac 1.5.0` encoded all three test files, and its own decoder round-tripped
them back to hashes identical to the 32-bit WAVs they came from. The files are
good.

**`dr_flac` cannot decode them, and does not say so.** Its frame-header table

```c
const drflac_uint8 bitsPerSampleTable[8] = {0, 8, 12, -1, 16, 20, 24, -1};
```

still marks index 7 as reserved, which is the code FLAC 1.4 assigned to 32 bits,
and `DRFLAC_ASSERT(pFlac->bitsPerSample <= 24)` appears throughout its decode
paths. The result is not an error: it opens the file, reports 32 bits from
STREAMINFO, and decodes **zero frames**. Media Foundation refuses these files
outright, which is at least honest.

For a player whose entire claim is bit-exactness, a decoder that produces silence
of length zero is the worst failure mode available: `read` returns 0, the graph
calls that the end of the stream, and the track is skipped without a word. So
`mp::Decoder::open` now decodes one frame and rewinds before declaring success,
and a decoder that produces nothing is refused with a sentence rather than
accepted with an empty file:

```
f32_44k.flac    cannot decode: the decoder opened the file and produced no audio at all
```

That check costs one frame at open and guards every decoder, including ones not
written yet.

**FFmpeg decodes these files correctly** -- byte-identical to the reference
decoder, despite its own encoder being unable to write one. So this gap has a
known shape and a known fix: `decode_ffmpeg`, the third module §7 already plans
for. That is the first concrete reason to build it rather than a general
appeal to coverage.

## Limits found by testing the edges

- **`dr_wav` refuses anything above 384 kHz** — `DRWAV_MAX_SAMPLE_RATE`, its own
  sanity ceiling against garbage headers, not a WAV limit: the field is 32 bits
  wide. It turned a perfectly good 768 kHz file into "unsupported by this module",
  which reads like our decision rather than a vendored constant. Raised to
  6,144,000 Hz, which is past every rate that exists while still bounding what a
  malformed header can claim.
- **Media Foundation will not decode FLAC above about 655 kHz.** It handles 32-bit
  WAV at 1,048,575 Hz without complaint, so this is its FLAC decoder rather than
  the framework. The two decoders cover each other exactly here, which is the
  clearest argument the module architecture has produced so far: neither one alone
  reads everything in this table.
- **FFmpeg's FLAC *encoder* writes 24 bits even when given `-sample_fmt s32`**, so
  a genuine 32-bit FLAC needs the reference encoder. `dr_flac` *looked* ready for
  one — it rejects only `subframeBitsPerSample > 32` — which is exactly why
  looking ready is not evidence. See the section above.
- **Above 655350 Hz a FLAC leaves the streamable subset**, because the frame
  header can only carry a rate in Hz (16 bits), in kHz (8 bits) or in tens of Hz
  (16 bits); anything larger has to be read from STREAMINFO. `flac` refuses with
  `FLAC__STREAM_ENCODER_INIT_STATUS_NOT_STREAMABLE` until given `--lax`. The files
  are legal FLAC; they are just not in the subset every decoder promises.
- **FFmpeg's FLAC encoder also picks an invalid block size above ~600 kHz**,
  choosing 65536 when the format's maximum is 65535, and refuses its own choice.
  `-frame_size 4096` works around it.

## Fuzzing

`dr_wav` and `dr_flac` have libFuzzer targets in `fuzz/`, built with ASan and run
for thirty seconds each in CI. A longer local campaign — eight minutes across the
two, at about 150,000 executions a second — found **no crashes**, and grew the
coverage corpus to 474 WAV and 2,113 FLAC inputs.

That is a short campaign and it proves correspondingly little. What it does prove
is that the machinery works, which is the part that rots.

## Still untested

- 8-bit WAV, which is unsigned and would need a conversion to reach any of our
  sample types; `decode_native` refuses it deliberately rather than converting.
- Anything above two channels, at any depth.
- DSD in any form: DoP is designed for and not implemented.
